# Sales Dashboard Using SQL and Power BI

This project utilizes fake data via the AdventureWorks dataset provided for free by Microsoft at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ssms.

In this project, we pretend we have received several business requirements from a Sales Manager who requests a dashboard to help provide an overview of sales, as well as a somewhat zoomed in view of customers and products, respectively. A full list of the business requirements can be seen in the Business Requirements Overview word doc included in this repo.

Utilizing SQL and SQL Server Management Studio, various data cleaning and prep work was performed to create four tables which were then loaded into Power BI. The result is a Power BI report with a page for Sales Overview, Customer Details, and Product Details. You can run the .pbix file on your own machine, or see the dashboard here: https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiYTQ1ZjdmYjMtM2Q3Ny00MTExLThiZDEtODcyYjA4NzNiNGZlIiwidCI6Ijg1YzYwZWRjLWRlMmItNDBmOS04Mjc1LTQ0MzkxYTNmODQ5NCIsImMiOjF9
